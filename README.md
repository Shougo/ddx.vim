# ddx.vim

> Dark deno-powered hexadecimal plugin for Vim/Neovim

If you don't want to configure plugins, you don't have to use the plugin. It
does not work with zero configuration. You can use other plugins.

## Introduction

I have chosen denops.vim framework to create new plugin. Because denops.vim is
better than Neovim Python interface.

- Easy to setup
- Minimal dependency
- Stability
- Vim/Neovim compatibility
- Speed
- Library
- Easy to hack

## Install

**Note:** Ddx.vim requires Vim 9.0.1499+ or Neovim 0.10.0+. See
[requirements](#requirements) if you aren't sure whether you have this.

### Requirements

Please install both Deno 1.45+ and "denops.vim" v8.0+.
